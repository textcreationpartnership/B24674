            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEREAS We are given to understand that several non-Commissioned Officers and Souldiers of the Old Regiments in His Majesties Army in this Kingdom, have of late, in hopes of being advanced in the New Regiments lately Raised, and a Raising for His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Service, deserted the Troops and Companies to which they formerly belonged, to the great preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of His Majesties Service, and the weakning of the said Old Regiments. We do therefore hereby Will and Require all Officers in any Regiment, Troop or Company where such men formerly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listed in any Old Regiment, Troop or Company of this Army, now are Inlisted or Entertained, not having Discharges from their former Officers as aforesaid, upon pain of being presently Cashiered, forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to Discharge and send them back to their former Colours.</p>
            <p>And We likewise Will and Require the said non-Commissioned Officers and souldiers to repair immediately to their former Colours, where they shall be again received, entertained, and pardoned for their said Offence; but in case of refusal or neglect herein, shall be proceeded against according to the utmost Rigour of the Laws and Ordinances of War.</p>

            <p>And whereas We did by Our Declaration of the 20th of <hi>July</hi> last past, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect that each private Centinel in the Regiment of Guards should have and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive weekly, and every week, two shillings and six pence. And in the other Regiments of his Majesties Army two shillings for his subsistence: Now in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that His Majesties Revenue has considerably of late fallen and decreased, and doth daily fall and decrease, We have thought fit to order that each pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Centinel in the Regiment of Guards receive till further orders but only two shillings, and in the other Regiments of Foot only eighteen pence weekly, by way of subsistence, from the first day of <hi>January</hi> next, but that he shall be intituled to the remainder of his full pay, and shall be duly accounted with for the same, and satisfied and paid it when ever His Majesties Revenue shall be in a condition to afford it. All which We think fit to publish and declare, to the end that all Officers and Souldiers herein concerned may take notice of Our pleasure in these particulars. And it is Our further pleasure, that this Our Declaration be forthwith Read and published at the Head of every Troop and Company; and also be posted up, and fixed in the Markets, and all other pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick places in all Cities, Towns, Garrisons and Quarters in and throughout this Kingdom, to the end that no person what-ever may plead ignorance of the same.</p>
